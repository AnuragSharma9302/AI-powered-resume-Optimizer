## Installation (local)

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd careercraft-ai
```

2. Create a Python venv and activate it (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# mac/linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# windows (powershell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables (Firebase etc.)

Create a `.env` file in the project root with at least:

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# any other Firebase or app-specific keys
```

5. Run the app:

```bash
# if your entry is streamlit_app.py
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# or if main.py is the entry
streamlit run main.py
```

Open the URL printed in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).
